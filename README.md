## 📝 Overview

Deep learning powers state-of-the-art AI systems. This repository presents:

- End-to-end pipelines using neural networks and transfer learning  
- Applications in image classification, object detection, and segmentation  
- Use of pre-trained models (e.g., VGG16, EfficientNet, YOLOv8)  
- Training on custom datasets with augmentation and fine-tuning  
- Model exporting for deployment (ONNX, TFLite, TorchScript)

The notebooks are written in Python and are designed for both learning and real-world implementation.
